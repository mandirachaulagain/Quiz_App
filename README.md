My quiz app is designed for school children, and its main feature is the trailing icon on the result screen to indicate correct and incorrect answers. The userâ€™s score is displayed on the score screen, using the variable $score. The main.dart file routes the landing screen page and the quiz screen page. I used Navigator.pushAndRemoveUntil to navigate back to the quiz screen. The issue I faced while creating this app was with implementing the trailing icon feature.
